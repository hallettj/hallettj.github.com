title: Anatomy of a Syllable

The syllable is a constant feature in every spoken language in the
world. Each language has its own rules about what kinds of syllables
are allowed, and what kinds aren't - but the general structure is the
same everywhere.

A syllable has as many as three parts: *onset*, *nucleus*, and
*coda*. The onset and the coda are consonants, or consonant clusters,
that appear at the beginning and the end of the syllable
respectively. The nucleus forms the the core of the syllable; it is
most often a vowel, or a combination of vowels - but there are many
exceptions to that. If you examine enough languages you can find
almost every kind phone used as a syllable nucleus. In the word "far",
\[f\] is the syllable onset, \[a\] is the nucleus, and \[r\] the coda. If a
coda is present in a syllable, the nucleus and the coda form a single
unit called a *rhyme*; otherwise the nucleus makes up the rhyme by
itself. Looking at "far" again, \[ar\] forms the rhyme. A syllable does
not necessarily have to have an onset or a coda - depending on the
language - but a nucleus is always present.

Even in English, syllable nuclei are not restricted to vowels. For
example, in the monosyllabic word, "hmm", the syllable nucleus is \[ṃ\],
which is a consonant but is more specifically a *nasal*. Another
nasal, \[n\], can be seen as a syllable nucleus in the word "isn't",
which is transcribed into the [International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)][IPA]
as \[ɪzzṇt\]. In this case there are two syllables, and \[ṇ\] forms the
nucleus of the second syllable.

The small dot underneath the characters ṇ and ṃ indicates that the
sound represented is a *syllabic consonant*, which is any consonant
that forms a syllable nucleus. Vowels are not marked with the same
diacritic because they are always considered to be syllabic. Usually
syllabicity is marked in IPA with a vertical stroke under the character
instead of a dot; but in this case a dot was as close as I could get.

Anyone following closely may notice that it is difficult to decide
exactly how to divide "isn't" into syllables. It seems like it should
be either \['ɪz.ṇt\], or \['ɪ.zṇt\], where the dot (.) represents a
syllable boundary and the apostrophe (') represents the beginning of a
stressed syllable; but it is tricky to figure out whether the \[z\] is
the coda of the first syllable or the onset of the second
syllable. That is because in the \[z\] in "isn't" demonstrates
*ambisyllabicity*, a common feature in English that I will write about
in a future article. The short explanation is that \[z\] is both an
onset and a coda, which is why I transcribed the word with two
\[z\]'s. Anyway, in both analyses \[ṇ\] forms the nucleus of the second
syllable, so we don't need to worry about the placement of \[z\] for
now.

There are also arguably cases where a *liquid* forms the nucleus of a
syllable in English. The liquids in English are \[l\] and \[r\]. Consider
the word "sir" and the second syllable of "apple". If it is the case
that the liquids in these syllables are the nuclei, then the words
would be transcribed as \[sṛ\] and \[æppḷ\] respectively. However, not
everybody agrees with that interpretation, and so these words are
often analyzed as \[sər\] and \[æppəl\]. That would make the syllable
nuclei \[ə\], which is a vowel. And by the way, the \[p\] in "apple" is
also ambisyllabic.

The reason vowels are so likely to form syllable nuclei is that they
are the most *sonorous* sounds available in spoken language. It is a
general rule that syllable nuclei are formed by sonorous
phones. Liquids and nasals are right behind vowels in that they are
more sonorous than any other type of consonant. But it is possible to
find syllable nuclei in other languages that are considerably less
sonorant than any of the above. For example, there is at least one
[Berber language][] that contains syllables like \[tḳt\], where the
nucleus of the syllable is \[ḳ\].

The onset and coda are always made up of consonants. Many languages
have strict rules about how many consonants can appear, and what sort
of order they appear in. English is relatively lax in this respect, so
we can see syllables with several consonants clustered together in
both positions. For example, "scrumptious", transcribed as
\['skrʌmp.ʃəs\], has three distinct consonant phones in the onset and
two in the coda of the first syllable. But notice that you would never
see a word in English like \['rksʌpm.ʃəs\], which would probably be
spelled "rksupmtious". Try pronouncing that and see what happens - and
remember that it's cheating to make the \[r\] or the \[m\] into separate
syllables!

Consonants in syllable onsets and codas are also governed by
sonority. There is a rule, called the *sonority sequencing
generalization*, that says that the sonority of a syllable peaks at
the nucleus and decreases toward either boundary. So the sonority of
consonants in the onset is supposed to increase going forward, and the
sonority in the coda is supposed to fall of. This is a generalization,
so there are exceptions - but if you deviate too much from the rule the
result becomes difficult to pronounce. In the made-up word above I
reversed the order of the consonants in the onset and coda of the
first syllable, thus making the sonority sequence "wrong".

Every sound in a language has a place somewhere in the sonority
hierarchy. And every language has its own sonority hierarchy
ordering. So for example \[star\] is easy for English speakers to
pronounce, but you don't see a word like \[tsar\]: \[t\] is more sonorous
than \[s\] in English. But in Russian it is not uncommon to see a word
like \[tsar\].

Restrictions on what is allowed in a syllable vary from language to
language. Not all languages allow as many consonants to be clustered
in a syllable onset as English does, while some allow more. Some
languages require every syllable to have an onset, while others allow
naked nuclei. Syllable codas are especially restricted. For example,
in Mandarin Chinese the only syllable codas that are allowed are
nasals. There are no languages that forbid onsets, but many languages
don't allow syllable codas to appear at all.
