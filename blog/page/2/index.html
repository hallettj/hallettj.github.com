  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I gave a talk at <a href="http://pdxruby.org/" title="Portland Ruby Brigade">Portland Ruby Brigade</a> meeting on
<a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" title="CouchDB">CouchDB</a>, a document-oriented database.  I thought I would share my notes
from that talk.  In some respects this was a followup to <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pdxruby/browse_thread/thread/6f8734846d3e16d3" title="Comparing MongoDB, Tokyo Tyrant, and CouchDB">an earlier talk that
Igal Koshevoy gave comparing various post-relational databases</a>.
Igal also wrote <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/pdxruby/browse_thread/thread/7865318fbc65d0d1" title="Ruby Persistence with CouchDB">some additional notes on my talk</a>.</p>

<p>In summary, some of the distinguishing features of CouchDB are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schema-less data store stores documents containing arbitrary JSON data.</li>
  <li>Incrementally updated map-reduce views provide fast access to data, support powerful data processing, and eliminate lookup penalties for data in large or deeply nested documents.</li>
  <li>Map-reduce views - which are again, incrementally updated - provide fast access to aggregate data, such as sums or averages of document attributes.</li>
  <li>Schema-less design means no schema migrations are ever required.  And new map-reduce views can be installed with no downtime.</li>
  <li>“Crash-only” design protects data integrity in almost every crash scenario.  No recovery process is required when rebooting a crashed database server.</li>
  <li>Lock-free design means that read requests never have to wait for other read or write requests to finish.  Writes are only serialized at the point where data is actually written to the disk.</li>
  <li>Integrated, robust master-master replication with automatic conflict handling</li>
  <li>MVCC, or “optimistic locking”, prevents data loss from multiple writes to the same document from different sources.</li>
  <li>RESTful interface makes it easy to integrate CouchDB with any environment that speaks HTTP.</li>
  <li>Documents can contain binary attachments.  Attachment support combined with the HTTP interface means that CouchDB can serve HTML, JavaScript, images, and anything else required to host a web application directly from the database.</li>
</ul>

<p>More detailed information on all of the above points can be found in <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/docs/overview.html" title="CouchDB Technical Overview">CouchDB’s
technical overview</a>.</p>

<p>Some of the downsides:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Writes and single-document lookups are slower than other databases due to HTTP overhead and frequent disk access.</li>
  <li>CouchDB optimizes CPU and RAM use by using lots of disk space.  The same data set will take up a lot more space in CouchDB than in other database systems.</li>
  <li>You must create map-reduce views in advance for any queries you want to run.  SQL users are used to processing data at query time; but this is not allowed by the CouchDB design (assuming you are not using temporary views in production, which you should not do.)</li>
  <li>There is a serious learning curve when learning to think in terms of map-reduce views.</li>
  <li>Map-reduce views, though very powerful, are not as flexible as SQL queries.  There may be cases where it is necessary to push data processing to an asynchronous job or to the client.</li>
  <li>CouchDB is a young project and its API is undergoing rapid changes.</li>
  <li>Documentation can be sparse - especially when very new features are involved.  </li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just for kicks I thought I would take another shot at some Haskell programming.
To get all of the common libraries and the automated package installer, cabal,
I set up the <a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/">Haskell Platform</a>. Here is how I did it.</p>

<p>Ubuntu Jaunty includes a package for the Haskell compiler, ghc, at version 6.8.
The Haskell Platform installer will roll its eyes at you if you try to proceed
with this version of ghc. So the first step is to install ghc 6.10.</p>

<p>Paste these lines into <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/haskell.list</code>:</p>

<pre><code>deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/someone561/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
deb-src http://ppa.launchpad.net/someone561/ppa/ubuntu jaunty main
</code></pre>

<p>To get the key to verify packages from that PPA, run this optional command:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E51D9310
</code></pre>

<p>Then update your package list and install Haskell:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ghc6 ghc6-prof ghc6-doc haddock
</code></pre>

<p>The Haskell Platform website does not list a package for Ubuntu yet. So
<a href="http://hackage.haskell.org/platform/">download the source installer</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDB</a> is a document-oriented database. It has no rows or tables. Instead
CouchDB is a collection of JSON documents. It uses a map-reduce pattern to
index data. Queries in CouchDB pull data from what are essentially stored
procedures called views. A view is made up of a map function and optionally a
reduce function.  Ninety percent of the time all you need is the map function,
so I will focus on map-only views here.</p>

<p>A map function is a JavaScript function that takes a single document as an
argument and emits any number of key/value pairs. Both the key and the value
can be any JSON value you choose. The map function is run on every document in
the database individually and the emitted key/value pairs are used to construct
an index of your data.</p>

<h2 id="a-simple-example">A Simple Example</h2>

<p>Imagine you have a database with user records and you want a view of those
records using the last name of each user as keys.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="js"><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">doc</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">doc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">last_name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">emit</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">doc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">last_name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">doc</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The above map function will produce and index something like the one below.
Because <code>doc</code> is used as a value for each entry the entire content of each JSON
document will be accessible as the indexed values.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="js"><span class="p">[</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
  <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">key</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Clarke&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">last_name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Clarke&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">key</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Kelly&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">last_name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Kelly&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">key</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="nx">value</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">last_name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Smith&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>  <span class="p">...</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Notice that the map function checks each document for a <code>last_name</code> attribute
before emitting a key/value pair. There may be documents in the database that
are not user records. By performing that check the view excludes any
non-user-record documents from the resulting index.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This information was written a long time ago and has become pretty outdated.</p>

<p><a href="http://sinatrarb.com/">Sinatra</a> is a fun little web application microframework. Recently I
started working on an application using Sinatra - and since I am
working on good programming habits, before I dove into any coding I
sat down to work out how to write specs for a Sinatra application.</p>

<p>Sinatra comes bundled with support for <a href="http://chneukirchen.org/repos/testspec/README">test/spec</a>: a spec framework
that builds on top of Rail’s own Test::Unit to provide support for
writing specs. Which is a really neat idea. But I have been using
<a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a> for my other work, and I wanted to continue doing so.</p>

<p>It turns out that RSpec takes a little bit of manual work to get
going with Sinatra. I read a <a href="http://www.gittr.com/index.php/archive/sinatra-rspec-integration-without-a-patch-with-examples/">helpful article on gittr.com</a> that
pointed me in the right direction. The article advised me to add these
lines to my spec files:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="nb">require</span> <span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">expand_path</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">dirname</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">__FILE__</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">&#39;/your_application&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;spec&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;spec/interop/test&#39;</span>
<span class="nb">require</span> <span class="s1">&#39;sinatra/test/unit&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The first line loads your application; the second line loads RSpec;
the third loads an RSpec-Test::Unit compatibility layer; and the
fourth loads Sinatra’s test helpers, which are written for
Test::Unit.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In <a href="http://sitr.us/ling/2007/09/24/anatomy-of-a-syllable/">last week’s post</a> I provided phonetic
transcriptions of some example words using the International Phonetic
Alphabet, or IPA for short. I thought it would be helpful to follow
that up with some information about what the IPA is, and how to read
it. And as a bonus, after learning about IPA transcription you will be
able to better read pronunciation guides on Wikipedia.</p>

<p>You have probably seen many phonetic transcriptions before -
especially as pronunciation guides in dictionaries. In dictionaries it
is common to see a transcription convention that uses English spelling
conventions to represent sounds. For example, the word “elucidate”
might be transcribed as (ee-LOO-suh-date). That system is handy
because it is immediately familiar to anyone who has experience
reading stuff in English. But it has drawbacks too. There are a few
main problems that are especially important for linguists; there are
lots of linguists all over the world who are used to languages with
entirely different spelling conventions. For example, the sound in
English that is represented as “y” - the consonant, not the vowel - is
written in Icelandic as “j”. There are also a lot of languages with
sounds that just don’t exist in English. Linguists need to be able to
transcribe those sounds; but since they don’t exist in English there
is no spelling convention to represent them. In fact there is no one
language with enough spelling conventions to represent every sound in
every language in the world. And finally, English spelling is
ambiguous, as is the spelling of almost any language. That is already
demonstrated by the need to add a note to distinguish “y” the
consonant from “y” the vowel or any of the other vowel sounds
represented by “y”.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The syllable is a constant feature in every spoken language in the
world. Each language has its own rules about what kinds of syllables
are allowed, and what kinds aren’t - but the general structure is the
same everywhere.</p>

<p>A syllable has as many as three parts: <em>onset</em>, <em>nucleus</em>, and
<em>coda</em>. The onset and the coda are consonants, or consonant clusters,
that appear at the beginning and the end of the syllable
respectively. The nucleus forms the the core of the syllable; it is
most often a vowel, or a combination of vowels - but there are many
exceptions to that. If you examine enough languages you can find
almost every kind phone used as a syllable nucleus. In the word “far”,
[f] is the syllable onset, [a] is the nucleus, and [r] the coda. If a
coda is present in a syllable, the nucleus and the coda form a single
unit called a <em>rhyme</em>; otherwise the nucleus makes up the rhyme by
itself. Looking at “far” again, [ar] forms the rhyme. A syllable does
not necessarily have to have an onset or a coda - depending on the
language - but a nucleus is always present.</p>

<p>Even in English, syllable nuclei are not restricted to vowels. For
example, in the monosyllabic word, “hmm”, the syllable nucleus is [ṃ],
which is a consonant but is more specifically a <em>nasal</em>. Another
nasal, [n], can be seen as a syllable nucleus in the word “isn’t”,
which is transcribed into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA)</a>
as [ɪzzṇt]. In this case there are two syllables, and [ṇ] forms the
nucleus of the second syllable.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When someone says to you, “here” or “now”, you probably know what he
means. “Here” might the room that you are both sitting in. “Now” would
be the span of time you spent sitting together. But if either word
were uttered under different circumstances, it could mean something
very different. For example, if I called you from the Andes and I used
the word, “here”, it would mean a mountainside somewhere - possibly
thousands of miles away from the aforementioned room. The same word
can mean both the room and the mountainside because of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deixis">deixis</a>.</p>

<p>Deixis is a form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exophora">exophora</a>, which is an utterance that is given
meaning by the context it is uttered in. Specifically, deixis
represents the speech event itself: deictic expressions reference the
speaker, the speaker’s utterances, the speaker’s location, and the
time at which the speech event occurs. There are different types of
deictic expressions that refer to each particular aspect.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_pronoun">Personal pronouns</a>, such as “I”, “you”, “he”, and “she”, are deictic
expressions. “I” refers simply to the speaker. The other pronouns are
defined by the relation the referenced person has to the speaker in
the discourse. As the role of speaker switches from person to person,
the context represented by deixis in understood by participants of the
discourse to change too.</p>
